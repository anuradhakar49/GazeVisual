# GazeVisual
Repository for GazeVisual performance evaluation software tools

The GazeVisual v1.1  is an open source graphical tool which is being currently developed to implement various metrics and visualizations for evaluating eye gaze datasets. It is in the form of a graphical user interface which will enable gaze researchers and general eye tracker users to effortlessly evaluate the data quality from their eye trackers. They can upload their gaze data to the software, estimate various gaze data accuracy metrics, generate visualizations and extract valuable information from their data to determine the capabilities and limits of their eye trackers.
You can view a demo video of the software here showing some of its operations. gaze_45 and gaze_75 are eye gaze datasets (in CSV formats containing gaze x, y coordinates of a user) and the ground_truth.csv file provides the corresponding ground truth of visual targets used for gaze data collection.
