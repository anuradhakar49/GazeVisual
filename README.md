# GazeVisual-Lib
A repository of software tools for practical evaluation of eye trackers and gaze data quality

This repository contains a set of methods implemented as Python codes which can be used on gaze data from generic/commercial eye trackers to evaluate their quality. The codes need Python 2.7 and the libraries imported in each code to be installed in order to run. Also the gaze data should be formatted properly before input to the evaluation codes. Details on data formatting are in the "Gaze data pre-processing" folder.
GazeVisual  is a graphical software tool included in this repository which implements various metrics and visualizations for evaluating eye gaze datasets. It is in the form of a graphical user interface which will enable gaze researchers and general eye tracker users to effortlessly evaluate the data quality from their eye trackers. They can upload their gaze data to the software, estimate various gaze data accuracy metrics, generate visualizations and extract valuable information from their data to determine the capabilities and limits of their eye trackers. Details about input data format for this software are in the “GazeVisual GUI Tool” folder

Several demo videos of the  GazeVisual software showing its operations may be viewed in the links below:
