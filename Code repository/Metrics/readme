In this folder there is a sample gaze data file (named user_data_proc.csv, which is produced from the main_proc.py program) and three python files which may be used to compute gaze data statistics, similarity between gaze datasets and gaze error spatial density on the display screen where gaze was tracked. 

1. data_statistics.py: This Python file calculates mean, standard and median absolute deviation, confidence intervals and Zscore from the input gaze csv file.

2. data_similarity.py: This code computes the similarity between data from different eye trackers, experiments or data from a test experiment and reference data. The similarity calculation is based on correlation, intersection and Bhattacharya distance computed on histograms of two gaze datasets

3. spatial_density.py: This code may be used to estimate the spatial distribution of gaze angular errors on the display screen. The code outputs the gaze error density values as a coloured heatmap plot.
