In this folder, there are three Python or .py files. All codes are released under GNU General Public License v3.0. The Jupyter notebook      Gaze data visualizations.ipynb also contains all the codes.
Install all the Python libraries first, change the path variables and then run the codes.

In this folder there is a sample gaze data file (user_data_proc.csv, output of the main_proc.py program) and three python codes that implement various gaze data/error visualizations.  All codes are released under GNU General Public License v3.0.

1. 3D_plot.py : This Python code creates a 3D plot showing the magnitude of gaze errors (plotted along Z axis) as a function of X and Y dimensions of the display screen. 

2. eccentricity.py : This Python code creates a polar plot of gaze error levels mapped with respect to visual angle values on the display screen, using data from the user_data_proc.csv file. 

3. 3D_histogram.py: This Python code plots stacked data distributions using data from two or more gaze data columns in a single plot. It helps to understand and compare data patterns from the different columns. Data can also be imported from different files for comparison.
