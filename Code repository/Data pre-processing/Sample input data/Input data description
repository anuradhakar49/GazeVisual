Three csv files, which can be used to test the main_proc.py Python code are uploaded here.
The c file contains the centralized on screen gaze data coordinates and timestamps for each data point
The l file contains the position of the left eye on screen during gaze data collection
The r file contains the position of the  right eye on screen during gaze data collection

Input files to main_proc.py should have formats as these files and stored in one folder
Naming convention for the files should be: desc1_dist_desc2_desc3.csv 
where "desc1", "desc2","desc3" are descriptive phrases for the data file. "desc1" must have 4 letters, dist must have 2 letters
representing user-tracker distance in cm.

Input gaze x,y coordinates (of the c file) should have value 0,0 at the center of the display screen (i.e. gaze data coordinates should have origin at the display screen center.
